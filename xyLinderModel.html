                Xylinder is a sample container. This is a new invention rather than a developed stage of the existing sample containing bags and boxes. The black strips are charged metallic strips. In the spaceship, there is a specific place with magnetic holders to store these containers. And because the sample container has charged magnetic strips, it fits well without falling or leaking. When the astronaut wants to take the xylinders (sample containers) out, it deactivates the magnetic field. This sample container has 1 button. When we press the button 4 legs will come out and the container can be stood. The colorful striped are the drawers. Each drawer is divided into 2 parts. So altogether there are 10 drawers. And all are vacuumed. When gives a small push to one drawer, it opens. And we can store one type of sample. This method is easy to handle and can be stored easily.
