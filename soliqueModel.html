            <div class="content">
                SOLIQUE is a robotic solid to liquid converter that helps in collecting solid ice and checking its composition roughly.If there is an area with ice (just like Dallol in Danakil depression in Africa ) we can send solique to that are without we stepping in. Solique will move from its wheels and will stop when we give the command. We are controlling solique from the tab or a remote controller and it is connected to the tab in astronaut’s hands and the base camp on the earth.If the solique wanted to stop at a certain area, then stoppers inside the 4 wheels would come out.There is a shovel (1)and a scraper (2) in the body of the solique. And these 2 come out from the bottom of the solique. Scraper has a sharp blade but it is flexible. Scraper will scrape the floor from right to left and the scraper will direct the scraped surface part to the shovel.This shovel has an automatic shutter. When it comes out , the shutter opens . And when it goes in , the shutter closes the shovel mouth. And the shovel will take the samples into the body of the solique. And the astronaut gives the command “heat”, so that the shovel gets heated. Since this is ice, the sensors in the shovel sends the signals to the tab with the astronaut saying that the ice solids has melted. And the sensors in the shovel can detect the particular composition of the solid which has collected. Then the astronaut gives the command for the solique to come back to him and if the samples are harmless , he can collect it.Collect it and add it to the sample container. If the samples are harmful, it will be kept in the body of the solique.
