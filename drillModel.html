                In Artimis program there are 3 main missions. Humans will go to the moon in mission 3. In mission 2, NASA will send a rover to the southern pole. This rover will cover the whole south pole. And collect data about the characteristics of its surface and the special areas like (areas with ice, areas with hard rocks, areas which we need to drill and check the inside). The rover traces everything and by using machine learning, in the 3rd mission, we input all the details into the sensors embedded in our Drill 360. By tracing all the areas which we need to drill, we are making the drill bits. These drill bits are based on the sizes of the areas and with different shapes. In the 3rd mission, when the astronauts go to the moon, and when they found a place to drill, they hold the drill closer to the area, and with the help of the sensors, our drill 360 will change into a perfect drill bit and the drilling process can go smoothly and perfectly.
